## Do you know why?

Even if you are in the worst condition, have pains, you are ALIVE! have a strong mind and the willpower to improve your condition from this moment on.

Change your questions and your mind will follow.

A "bad" question that will not help is: "Why is this happening to me?".
Instead, ask yourself: 

"What can I do to improve my situation?" 

"What are the necessary steps to reduce my pain?" 

"What have I not tried till now?"

"What are other people doing who are in a better condition or even in remission?"

Most importantly believe in yourself. I don't care what others say. YOU can accomplish anything and everything if you set your mind to it.

### Start with small steps and repeat them every day.

Change something in your diet like adding a [salad](https://factastichealth.com/eat-your-healthy-salad-with-every-meal) to your meals.

If you can and your doctor allows it do a [cleanse or fast](https://factastichealth.com/).

Change something in your sleeping habit and go early to bed and sleep (or just rest if can't sleep) at least for 8 hours.

Do some stress management with [breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v_aWw3WBcY) an [meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67SeR3LxtdI).

And definitely, do some exercise, yoga, stretching, walking, resistance training, whatever you can do without hurting yourself.

### Try to add a little improvement every day

and in no time you will see the astonishing results and what your body is really capable of.
