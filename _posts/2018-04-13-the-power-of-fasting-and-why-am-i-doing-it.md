I know, Fasting is not an easy process, just simple. Let me tell you my personal experience.

## Eating Urges, Pain, and Inflammation

The barrier to overcoming eating urges gets really low when you live with **chronic pain or inflammation**, especially when it affects sensitive organs like the eyes. In those moments, food can easily turn into comfort rather than nourishment.

To manage this, I usually choose between **a cleanse or a fast**. Both help reduce my pain, but in my experience, **fasting feels more powerful than cleansing**.

## Cleanse vs. Fast — What’s the Difference?

### 🥗 Cleansing
During a cleanse, I eat:
- Green salads (without dressing, as much as I want)
- Celery or cucumber juice  

This means it’s **not zero-calorie**, but usually around **200–400 calories per day**.

### 💧 Fasting
Fasting, on the other hand, is much stricter:
- **0–50 calories per day**
- Only **water or tea**



## When My Immune System Turned on Me

Recently, my immune system decided to attack my eye, causing **[Uveitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis)**.

Uveitis is the inflammation of the **[uvea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvea "Uvea")**, the pigmented layer that lies between:
- the inner **[retina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina "Retina")**, and  
- the outer layers of the **[sclera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclera "Sclera")** and **[cornea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea "Cornea")**.

If left untreated, uveitis can lead to **blindness**.

In my case, treatment included:
- Cortisone  
- Pupil‑dilating medication  



## How Cleansing Helped My Recovery

I started a **cleanse on day four** of my uveitis treatment, and the redness in my eye improved almost immediately.  
This ended up being **one of my longest cleanses**, lasting **four days**.

Whenever my autoimmune disease causes significant pain, I now instinctively start:
- a **cleanse or fast for at least 24–48 hours**

After that period, the pain is **almost completely gone**—until I return to “normal” food again.



## The After‑Effects

After cleansing or fasting:
- My **energy levels are fantastic**
- My body feels light and strong
- I genuinely feel *good*

It almost feels like **my gut healing was accelerated**, which is also supported by research  
([see this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4516560/)).



## Final Thoughts & Disclaimer

I highly suggest that **everyone—including healthy people—** try a cleanse or fast for a couple of days, just to experience the healing power and capacity of the human body.

⚠️ **Important:** Always consult your doctor before attempting a cleanse or fast.
