# Running 6 Hours in 0–4°C ❄️🥶

Six hours of running in temperatures hovering between **0–4°C** is a special kind of challenge. Cold enough to numb your fingers, warm enough to keep the snow half-melted, and just uncomfortable enough to test your mental toughness from the first kilometer to the last.

The night before the Rodgau Ultra, snow quietly covered the ground. It set the tone perfectly: this was not going to be a fast race, but it was going to be an honest one.

### Fueling Through the Cold

Before leaving for Rodgau, I prepared a **2‑liter smoothie**—my secret weapon for the early morning hours. Sipping it slowly before the start and during the race kept my energy steady and carried me all the way through **50 kilometers**. Simple, effective, and exactly what my body needed in the cold.

### Miles Made Easier by Company

Somewhere along the course, I made a new running friend. We fell into an easy rhythm, sharing the effort and the kilometers. Her pace and encouragement helped push me forward until **km 40**, where I finally had to let her go. Even so, those shared miles made a huge difference—proof that endurance is often a team effort, even in an individual sport.

### After the Finish Line

The race didn’t really end at the finish line. My legs were so spent that I could barely walk to the parking lot. Getting to my car was impossible on my own, and I needed a lift just to make it there.

Exhausted, cold, and barely able to walk—but deeply satisfied. Some runs don’t leave you feeling strong. They leave you feeling *earned*.
