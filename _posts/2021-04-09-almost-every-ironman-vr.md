## Racing Without a Finish Line

Almost every weekend since April 2020, I’ve completed a virtual triathlon.  
Sprint distance. Olympic. Half. Even full distance. Week after week, race after race—without crowds, without finish lines, without medals handed to me by volunteers. Just me, my watch, and the quiet agreement I made with myself to show up.

This journey started on **April 4, 2020**, with the launch of the Ironman VR series. The world had just slammed its brakes. Every real race was canceled. Calendars were wiped clean overnight. What was supposed to be a season of travel, nerves, and finish‑line photos suddenly became a season of uncertainty.

But instead of stopping, something unexpected happened.

I kept racing.

Virtual racing wasn’t glamorous. There were no aid stations, no spectators shouting your name, no shared suffering on the course. Some weekends the weather was perfect; others were lonely, cold, or painfully quiet. I learned how loud my own thoughts could be when there was nothing else to distract me. I learned how discipline feels when motivation doesn’t show up. And I learned that racing isn’t always about a place—it’s about a promise.

## Almost every weekend became an adventure in its own way.

One weekend pushed the idea of “fitting a race in” to a whole new level. In the middle of moving homes—boxes everywhere, furniture half assembled, life completely upside down—I still managed to complete a half Iron‑distance triathlon. The swim was done before the day really started, the bike fit in between loading and unloading, and the run came at the end of a long, exhausting day. It wasn’t pretty, it wasn’t planned perfectly, but it happened. That weekend proved to me that racing isn’t about perfect conditions—it’s about refusing to pause your goals, even when everything else is in motion.

One weekend I even had to skip a VR. Not because I was injured or burned out, but because I was on a **sailing boat**, floating somewhere between wind and water, and my bike was definitely not on board 😀 That felt oddly perfect. Racing had taken many forms by then, and that weekend, adventure simply looked different.

Virtual triathlons carried me through a strange chapter of life. They gave structure to chaos, purpose to empty calendars, and a reminder that progress doesn’t stop just because the world does. There was no finish line to run through, but there was still forward motion—and sometimes, that’s enough.

And somehow, weekend after weekend, I kept showing up.
