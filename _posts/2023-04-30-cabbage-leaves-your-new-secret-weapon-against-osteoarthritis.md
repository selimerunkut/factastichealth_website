Hey there, cabbage lovers! Did you know that cabbage leaves can do more than just make a great coleslaw? In fact, they can be your new secret weapon against osteoarthritis and joint inflammation.

Yes, you read that right. According to a recent study, applying cabbage leaves to your knees can provide relief from osteoarthritis pain. Now, before you get all excited and start wrapping your entire body in cabbage, let's take a closer look at the study.

The study, entitled [Efficacy of Cabbage Leaf Wraps in the Treatment of Symptomatic Osteoarthritis of the Knee: A Randomized Controlled Trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26889617), found that applying cabbage leaf wraps, every day, for 4 weeks, on the knees, was more effective than the usual drug with respect to pain, functional disability, and quality of life.
Munching on some cabbage can also have internal anti-inflammatory potential.

But wait, it gets better. The study was funded by none other than Germany's former President and First Lady's family foundation. Now, that's what I call a power move.

So, why exactly do cabbage leaves work? Well, the anti-inflammatory effects of cabbage may explain their health benefits for osteoarthritis. And if you're not a fan of cabbage leaves, fear not. Eating cabbage or other cruciferous vegetables may also have internal anti-inflammatory potential.

Cabbage leaves are a safe and effective option for osteoarthritis relief. And who knows, maybe we'll start seeing some fashionable cabbage leaf knee wraps on the streets.

So, next time you're feeling achy and in need of some relief, head to the nearest grocery store, grab a head of cabbage, and start wrapping those knees. Your joints (and possibly your fashion sense) will thank you.
This could also help after doing sports for inflamed joints.
