My TorTour de Ruhr 100 Mile Journey: A Test of Endurance and Camaraderie

The TorTour de Ruhr (TTdR) is not your average race. It's an invitation-only ultramarathon that follows the Ruhr River from its source in Winterberg to its mouth at the Rhine in Duisburg. This year, I took on the 100-mile (160.9km) challenge, known as the Ruhr Hundred or TTdR160.

The Journey Begins

My colleague a.k.a. crew drove me to the starting point in Arnheim, which was actually VP (Verpflegungsstation) number 6 for the 230km runners. After a few pre-race photos and a bit of a scramble to get my bib number sorted (they ended up modifying an existing one for me!), I was ready to go.

The race kicked off with a 13km prologue round. Unfortunately, I got a bit lost due to some confusing course markings. It was a minor setback, but a good reminder to always trust and use my navigation tools!

Dawn

As the hours ticked by and the sun came out, I met Anke and her crew. They were an absolute blast and kept me fueled and entertained. We even had a little adventure getting lost together and running through fields of stinging nettle! Eventually, Anke's pace was a bit too fast for me, so I joined up with Andreas and Jürgen, two running friends who were determined to finish together.

The Final Push

I stuck with Andreas and Jürgen for most of the race, walking and running together. But with 7km to go, I knew I had to pick up the pace if I wanted to finish under 27 hours and see the Rheinorange statue in daylight. I pushed myself to a 6.5-7.5 minute/km pace and crossed the finish line in 26 hours and 21 minutes.

Reflections on the TTdR

The TTdR is a unique and challenging race. The route is beautiful, winding through the Ruhr Valley and offering glimpses of industrial heritage and natural beauty. The camaraderie among runners and crews is incredible, and the support from volunteers at the VPs is invaluable.

Tips for Future TTdR Runners

Train for the distance: This is an ultramarathon, so be prepared for the physical and mental demands.
Bring a crew: Your crew is essential for support, navigation, and motivation.
Be prepared for anything: The weather can change, you might get lost, and you'll definitely be tired. But that's all part of the adventure!
Enjoy the experience: The TTdR is more than just a race. It's a journey through a unique landscape, a test of your limits, and an opportunity to connect with fellow runners.
If you're looking for a challenge and a chance to experience the Ruhr Valley in a whole new way, I highly recommend the TorTour de Ruhr. Just be prepared to work hard, have fun, and maybe even get lost along the way!
